##  Installation

###  Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Telegram Bot Token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

###  Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eraly-ml/against-toxic-telegram.git
   cd against-toxic-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set your bot token:**

   Create a `.env` file or export an environment variable:

   ```env
   TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
   ```

4. **Run the bot:**

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

##  How It Works

The bot listens for new messages in Telegram groups. When a message arrives:

1. It passes the message text to the `Detoxify` model.
2. If the message is flagged as toxic (above a configurable threshold), it is deleted.
3. A warning message is posted in the group.
4. The message content and toxicity scores are logged.

##  Example

A user sends:

> "You're such an idiot!"

Bot detects high toxicity and deletes the message, then posts:

>  Message deleted due to toxic language.

And logs:

```
Username, Message, Toxicity Score
john_doe, "You're such an idiot!", 0.92
```
